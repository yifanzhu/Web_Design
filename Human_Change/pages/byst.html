			<h2>Beyond Sustainability</h2>
			<p>
				What do we mean when we talk about sustainability and making the world sustainable?
				Are we saying we want to ensure that we do not make things worse for the future and that things at a minimum continue in a not lessened state?
				What a low benchmark this is. 
				It reminds one of the story in the bible when the father leaves his three sons some money before embarking on a journey.  When he returns, two of the sons had invested the money.  When the father took back what he had originally given them, they were left with all that they had made, but of the third son who had buried the money in the garden, it was said that this was taken from him and he was left with nothing.
				Surely life is the opportunity to invest and make more through conscious living and not just to ‘sustain’?
				Sustainable practices alone are not enough to stem the tide of the oncoming perfect storm of events threatening the planet - only Human Evolutionary Change IN CONJUNCTION WITH new sustainable practices can bring about change.* 
				*You might want to read the free download on the way an elevated human platform addresses the challenge of the polluted rivers and oceans and the free video on The Daffodil.
				We also hope you have immersed yourself in the free video called ‘The why, the how and the what’.  What we do (our practices) are very much a result of HOW we think.  Only the spiritual connection to WHY we do, can bring a new level of response to the challenges we face.
				The practices we share in this work are ‘Beyond Sustainability’ – they are patterns of growth and conscious evolution and are shared in the spirit of investing in and contributing towards a new future – and in so doing we ensure the growth and value of our own lives.

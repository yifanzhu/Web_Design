			<h2>About the story</h2>	
			<p>
				Within the larger arc of our evolution story, we have tried to SEE and understand the human situation and to find an appropriate response.
				Michael Shewchuk and Richard Bowell met at the United Nations in 2009.  A Legal Officer and International Lawyer at the United Nations charged with responsibilities in the sensitive area of the oceans and seas, Michael saw the need for a new way to address our significant challenges.
				Richard Bowell, Writer and Philosopher, has spent his life pursuing what the spiritual line of these times might be – and after forty years had mastered a level of access that had implications for a new paradigm.
				Working over many years together, Michael and Richard’s association has developed into a spiritual engagement that has flourished in the way they work together and offer the interaction of their adjacent experiences in the programs and writings and in talks.
				We are as two monks travelling from village to village walking the walk of spiritual awakening, not talking ‘about the work’, but always finding it new and fresh and demonstrating its power and portent.
				People tell us of the effect of joining an open spiritual pathway – the undeniable warmth of human engagement, the increasingly integrated perception, the sense of healing at core and the deep sense of belonging to a great purpose.
				The work is endorsed at the highest level with testimonials from international figures in Science and Leadership, Spirituality and Mediation – but always it is the impact this work has with people around the world living their lives that speaks loudest. 
				Until we can align our lives to the change that is within the meaning of our times, we will continue to feel, as so many do, that this is the first generation who believe that things cannot ever get better, that there is no hope.
				Human Evolutionary Change is the hope!

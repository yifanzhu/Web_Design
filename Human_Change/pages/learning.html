			<h2>Conscious Learning</h2>
			<p>

				The future way of learning cannot be the same – and here you will meet an entirely new ‘conscious’ learning.
				At root, we share with you a lifetime’s work on the universal laws that show the patterns and ways things work and grow - not just understanding of a static world.  
				The joy of learning in a new elevated paradigm is deeply transformative.  There is no subject that we cannot address and explore and find new perceptions about – all without previous study.
				People at the top of their professions have been constantly amazed when we show them the new elevated paradigm of Mediation, or Coaching or Resolving Conflict and tell them we have not arrived at this knowledge through books and the usual methods of study – but by connected and conscious engagement.
				Conscious learning – we call it ‘Evolution-centered learning’ – centers on the registration of higher sequences.
				Example: 
				1.	‘I want to save the planet’ is a phrase that suggests doing something worthy and begs the question ‘how’ whereas…

				2.	‘Living on a planet causes me to want to be responsible as a human being – to be in tune with its purposes whilst pursuing my own’, is a higher sequence and a direct connection to a new purpose – a new ‘why’… 
				In the first sentence, ‘I’ thinks it can sort out the world situation (arrogance and delusion).
				In the second sentence, we find ourselves inside the responsibility of living on a planet and seek an aligned response (attuned to service and contribution).
				Higher sequences are the basis of all healing, elevation, alignment, mediation, etc.  It is the understanding of these sequences that you will have access to as a member.

				Come learn with us now!

			<h2>A Practical Spiritual Philosophy of our Times</h2>
			<p>This IS the new paradigm – laid out and accessible for all!
				There are many new and bold initiatives being undertaken around the world, but without a fundamental elevation in human thinking and a substantive re-engagement with our humanity it will not be enough to change the course of the future.
				The work of Human Evolutionary Change is born of a higher purpose.  It is not only practical, but it attunes each person to the spiritual human core – only from there can we ACT. 
				In discussions at the highest levels with such organizations as the United Nations, the focus inevitably turns to the search for a new way of addressing these significant challenges and we are asked:
				•	What new trainings are there for people to enter the new paradigm? 
				•	In what way can the challenges of our times be addressed from a new level?

				Here are the trainings and programs for the future - made available for people worldwide– and not a moment too soon!
				We are facing such unprecedented challenges.  Even the Sustainable Development Goals and the nearly 170 related targets cannot hope to avert catastrophe in our lifetime.  It is our expectation based on the most up to date science that the toll on the human race can only increase very dramatically in the years ahead.

				You may well wonder how the insights, perceptions and practices in this work can avert global warming, widespread regional conflict, massive pollution and the devastation of our oceans.  It is because our thinking assumes we can just change the big things – when it is the small changes inside ourselves, repeated over time, that grow to a large result.  
				As Albert Einstein famously remarked, ‘The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them’.  Here is the ‘level’ of thinking that can address the challenges we face – endorsed by scientists and leaders, academics and spiritual luminaries worldwide. 
				Again and again we have seen that the missing step is when we re-connect to our deep humanity – then we become transformed in a way where we would never conceive of acting in conflict with others, or our environment.  
				There is no greater cause of the problems we face today than that we humans are living lives that do not align us to the purpose of being human.  
				This work encourages people into an inner elevation from which they demonstrate more compassion, more conscious awareness of the environment and establish a clearer platform from which to address the challenges of our times.  
				The more people undertake this engagement the more it strengthens the perception of our place on this planet and our part in the course of evolution’s history.  
				Only when we are nudged back to the line of our essential humanity and spiritual purpose can we then DO more.

				Come and join us - it is a Global Movement for a New World!
